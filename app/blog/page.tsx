                Taxing Laughter: The Joke Tax Chronicles

              Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king who spent all day lounging on his throne.
              One day, his advisors came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and leaving jokes all over the place:
              under the king's pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn't seem
              to stop Jokester.
            </p>
            <p>
              And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes left by Jokester were so funny that
              they couldn't help but laugh. And once they started laughing, they couldn't stop.

            <p>
              The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with
              <a href="#">a brilliant plan</a>: he would tax the jokes in the kingdom.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              “After all,” he said, “everyone enjoys a good joke, so it's only fair that they should pay for the
              privilege.”
            </blockquote>
            <h3>The Joke Tax</h3>
            <p>The king's subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but the king was firm:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>
              <li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>
              <li>3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a gloom. But there was one person who
              refused to let the king's foolishness get him down: a court jester named Jokester.
